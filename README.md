# Tech Interview Handbook

Handbook to help you ace your next technical interview, with a focus on algorithms and the front end domain. System design questions are in-progress.

This handbook is pretty new and help from you in contributing content would be very much appreciated!

## Motivations

While there are many awesome books like [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) and interview-related repositories on Github that contain a lot of algorithm questions, for more domain-specific and non-software engineering questions, there seems to be a lack in resources. This handbook aims to cover questions beyond the algorithm coding questions.
