# Tech Interview Handbook

Handbook to help you ace your next technical interview, with a focus on algorithms and the front end domain. System design questions are in-progress. Besides the usual algorithm questions, other **awesome** stuff include:

- [How to prepare](preparing) for coding interviews
- [Tips and best questions to practice](algorithms) for each algorithm topic
- [Detailed answers](front-end/interview-questions.md) to the famous "Front-end Job Interview Questions"
- [Interview formats](non-technical/format.md) of the famous tech companies
- [Behavioural questions](non-technical/behavioral.md) categorized by companies
- [Good questions to ask](non-technical/questions-to-ask.md) your interviewers the end of the interviews

This handbook is pretty new and help from you in contributing content would be very much appreciated!

## Motivations

While there are many awesome books like [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) and interview-related repositories on Github that contain a lot of algorithm questions, for more domain-specific and non-software engineering questions, there seems to be a lack in resources. This handbook aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions.

## Contents

- **[Algorithm Questions](algorithms)** - Questions categorized by topics.

  - [Front-end Job Interview Questions and Answers](front-end/interview-questions.md) üî•‚≠ê
- **[Non-Technical Tips](non-technical)** - Random non-technical tips that cover behavioral and psychological aspects, interview formats and "Do you have any questions for me?".
  - [Behavioral Questions](non-technical/behavioral.md)
  - [Interview Formats](non-technical/format.md)
  - [Psychological Tricks](non-technical/psychological.md)
  - [Questions to Ask](non-technical/questions-to-ask.md)
  - [Negotiation Tips](non-technical/negotiation.md)
