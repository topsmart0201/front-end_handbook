# Tech Interview Handbook

Handbook to help you ace your next technical interview, with a focus on algorithms and the front end domain. System design questions are in-progress. Besides the usual algorithm questions, other cool stuff include:

- [Interview formats](non-technical/format.md) of the famous tech companies!
- [Behavioural questions](non-technical/behavioral.md) categorized by companies!
- A list of [GOOD questions to ask](non-technical/questions-to-ask.md) your interviewers the end of the interviews!

This handbook is pretty new and help from you in contributing content would be very much appreciated!

## Motivations

While there are many awesome books like [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) and interview-related repositories on Github that contain a lot of algorithm questions, for more domain-specific and non-software engineering questions, there seems to be a lack in resources. This handbook aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions.
