Many front end interviews are highly-focused on domain knowledge and applying them to real-world scenarios. You might find that grinding LeetCode is not extremely useful when it comes to interviewing for a front end position, and that's a good thing! But that doesn't mean that you don't have to be familiar with basic data structure and algorithmic concepts - it's just that the concepts that you're tested on are more practical and relevant to real front end development.

## Front End Interviews Formats

Unlike Software Engineering interviews, the formats for front end interviews are less known and less standard. However, there are a few common formats:

- **Pop Quiz** - Short questions which test your knowledge and have clear non-subjective answers. E.g. Explain the `this` keyword in JavaScript
- **Algorithms** - LeetCode-style algorithmic coding questions, but solve them using JavaScript
- **Write a small utility function/library** - Implement a common function in JavaScript. This is the front end version of LeetCode-style algorithm questions. E.g. Implement the `debounce` function found in Underscore/Lodash
- **Build a UI component/game** - Write HTML, CSS and JavaScript to implement a UI component or a small app/game. E.g. Build a tabs component, Tic-tac-toe Game, Tetris Game
- **Design a UI component/app/game** - Describe and discuss how you would build a UI component/app/game. This is the front end version of system design questions. E.g. Describe how you would build Emoji autocomplete feature in a chat app

## General Tips

Regardless of which type of format you are given, one thing stays true - you need to be extremely strong in your front end fundamentals and constantly display mastery of them to your interviewer.

Be _extremely_ familiar with the following concepts:

- CSS: Specificity, Box model, Layout, Positioning
- JavaScript: `this` keyword, Prototypes, closures, Async-style code, Promises, Timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`)
- JavaScript Design Patterns: Observer pattern, Module pattern
- HTML: Event delegation (it was useful in almost every interview), DOM traversal, DOM manipulation, Form validation and submission
- Vanilla JS, or jQuery at the very least. Not all interviews allow you to use React as they want to see mastery of lower-level stuff

Look out for interview questions by the companies on Glassdoor. Front end questions are not as abundant but some still can be found. Many companies use similar questions.
