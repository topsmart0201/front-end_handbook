title: Design a UI Component/App/Game
---

Just to be clear, design here refers to code/API design and not UI design. This format of question is quite similar to the above and there's a significant amount of overlap between the former and this - you will likely need to do some design in the former and also do some coding here to illustrate your ideas/app state format.

The difference between this section and the above is that the questions here are usually larger. If the session is only half an hour, candidates are expected to talk about the design tradeoffs, possible implementations, instead of coding it out. Because this format of questions involve multiple components and knowledge across the web stack, candidates usually do not have to go very deep into the lower-level details and can keep the discussion at a higher level.

Many of the topics mentioned above are also relevant in this format of questions - API design, scalability, performance, user experience, i18n, accessibility, security. Candidates should take the initiative and bring these topics up and lead the discussion with the interviewer. The more advanced topics such as performance, accessibility and i18n are what differentiates senior candidates from the more junior ones.

If you possess a laptop and are asked to code them out, you usually can use a JavaScript framework/library and in that case you are recommended to use tools that help you scaffold a fresh app where you can start coding immediately (e.g. `create-react-app`, `vue-cli`). You don't want to be spending time during the interview doing unnecessary plumbing that doesn't give your interviewers additional useful signals.

## Basic Examples

- Tic-tac-toe Game
- Whack-a-mole Game
- Sortable Data Table (with extensions for filtering)

## Advanced Examples

If you have to implement these, usually you are given more than half an hour

- WYSIWYG Editor
- Tetris Game
- Snake Game
