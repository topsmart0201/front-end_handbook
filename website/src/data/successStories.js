        process and has tons of awesome tips and resources. With this handbook

        Before discovering the handbook, I didn't know what to expect for my
        frontend interviews. Thanks to it, I had a better understanding and even
        learned new things about frontend development. The handbook is an
        immense resource, one that I still use to refresh and reinforce my
        knowledge to tackle interviews confidently!

        The Tech Interview Handbook played a crucial role in the success of my
        previous job search. The contents are carefully curated and well
        organized. It served as an excellent roadmap for my interview prep.

        <br />
        In addition to the thorough Data Structures and Algorithms section, the
        handbook also provides a lot of resources on other aspects of the
        application process that helped me see the tech interviews in a more
        holistic way. My favorite non-technical part was "Questions To Ask"! I
        used quite a few insightful questions from there to challenge and
        impress my interviewers. The results were great!

        With the help of Tech Interview Handbook, I was able to land offers from
        Google, Amazon, Uber and several other great companies. Really
        appreciate Yangshun and other contributors for putting out such quality
        content for the community. I'd wholeheartedly recommend this handbook to
        anyone!
