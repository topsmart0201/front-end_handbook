  - Alien Dictionary Topological Sort question.
- Find if a given string matches any path in a labeled graph. A path may contain cycles.
- Given a friendship graph (an undirected graph where nodes represent people and edges means two people know each other), find all your 2nd degree connections (friendsâ€™ friends). Output these 2nd degree connections ranked by number of common friends (i.e 1st degree connections) with you, (example: if 2nd degree connection A has 10 common friends (1st degree connections) with you but 2nd degree connection B has 8 common friends (1st degree connections) with you, then A should be ranked first).
- Given a bipartite graph, separate the vertices into two sets.
- Given a list of email addresses, and a similarity function which says whether two email addresses are similar, write a function to separate the list into sets of email addresses that are similar to each other.
- You are a thief trying to sneak across a rectangular field. There are alarms placed on the fields and they each have a circular sensing radius which will trigger if anyone steps into it. Each alarm may not have the same radius. Determine if you can get from one end of the field to the other end.
- Given a graph and two nodes, determine if there exists a path between them.
- Determine if a cycle exists in the graph.
