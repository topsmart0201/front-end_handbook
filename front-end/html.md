## Script Loading

- `<script>` - HTML parsing is blocked, the script is fetched and executed immediately, HTML parsing resumes after the script is executed.
- `<script async>` - The script will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed as soon as it is available (potentially before HTML parsing completes). Use `async` when the script is independent of any other scripts on the page, for example analytics.
- `<script defer>` - The script will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed when the page has finished parsing. If there are multiple of them, each deferred script is executed in the order they were encounÂ­tered in the document.
